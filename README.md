# Crack Detaction

Crack Detaction is a Flask/OpenCV research application for identifying candidate crack-like regions in concrete, road, wall, and pavement images. It reports measurements in pixels and optionally converts them to millimeters when a valid pixels-per-millimeter calibration is provided. Its severity labels are configurable software categories, not professional structural safety judgments.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- MongoDB Community Server, or a MongoDB Atlas connection string

## Setup

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your MongoDB URI and a secret key. The default database is `crack_detection_db`. The app stores image stages and reports under `storage/`; those files are intentionally not stored in MongoDB.

## Run

### Automatic Windows launch

Double-click [`run_crackscope.bat`](./run_crackscope.bat). It will:

1. Create `.venv` if it does not exist.
2. Create `.env` from `.env.example` if needed.
3. Install or update the Python dependencies.
4. Start Flask on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
5. Wait until Flask responds and open the upload page in your default browser.

Keep the **Crack Detaction Flask Server** console open while using the application. Close that console to stop Flask.

### Manual launch

```powershell
python app.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Use **Upload** to select one or more JPG, JPEG, JFIF, or PNG files. Pixel-to-millimeter calibration is applied automatically using the configured default of 10 pixels/mm. Detection starts automatically; uploads that contain no detected crack are rejected with an error. Results include original, preprocessing stages, segmentation, skeletons, and annotated images. The analysis page provides CSV, PDF, and ZIP downloads.

## Processing workflow

The pipeline resizes while preserving aspect ratio, converts to grayscale, applies Gaussian blur and CLAHE, computes a BlackHat transform, thresholds with Otsu, cleans morphology, filters connected components, skeletonizes each candidate, estimates skeleton length and distance-transform width, and draws annotated results. Synthetic tests exercise this pipeline; real photographs still require domain validation and suitable calibration.

## Tests

```powershell
pytest -q
```

If MongoDB is unavailable, the Flask process still starts and keeps newly created results available for the current running session. Configure MongoDB for permanent history and access after restarting Flask.

## Troubleshooting

- Check that MongoDB is running and `MONGO_URI` is correct.
- Ensure the account can create indexes and collections.
- Increase `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` for larger images.
- Candidate detection is sensitive to lighting, texture, and the configured BlackHat and minimum-area parameters.
